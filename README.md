# :japanese_castle: React-Three-Next starter


Lighthouse total minimum score of 93 with First Load JS of 78Kb. This starter will automatically pick the marked R3F components and inject them into a canvas layout so we can navigate seamlessly between the pages with some dynamic dom and canvas content without reloading or creating a new canvas every time.

### üî≤ Demo :

### How to use

#### Installation

_Tailwind is the default and only stable_

```sh
yarn create r3f-app next my-app <tailwind?>
```

or

```sh
npx create-r3f-app next my-app <tailwind?>
```

### :mount_fuji: Features

- [x] Concurrent mode with React experimental
- [x] Automatically inject r3f component in the Canvas layout
- [x] Customizable loading
- [x] Support glsl, images and svg imports
- [x] PWA Support
- [x] Dynamic meta data and header using Helmet
- [x] Clean code using ESlint, Prettier and Husky

### :bullettrain_side: Architecture

Inform the nextjs page that the component is a Threejs component. For that, simply add the **r3f** property to the parent component.

```jsx
const Page = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello !</h1>
      {/* Simply add the r3f prop to the parent component -> */}
      <Group r3f />
      <h2>Bonjour.</h2>
      <MeshComponent r3f />
    </>
  )
}

export default Page
```

#### Why using a custom server in dev ?

Because next-transpile-module is pretty heavy while we are working in development, we use a custom server to supply node with the `--max-old-space-size=4096` parameter which extend the basic limit of RAM (512mb) available to our server before it can crash. Otherwise, on heavy website we spend our time restarting the local server.
