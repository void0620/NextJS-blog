# :japanese_castle: React-Three-Next starter

First Load JS of 76Kb. This starter will automatically pick the marked R3F components and inject them into a canvas layout so we can navigate seamlessly between the pages with some dynamic dom and canvas content without reloading or creating a new canvas every time.

### ‚ö´ Demo :

### How to use

#### Installation

_Tailwind is the default and only stable_

```sh
yarn create r3f-app next my-app
```

or

```sh
npx create-r3f-app next my-app
```

### :mount_fuji: Features

- [x] Automatically inject r3f component in the Canvas
- [x] Support glsl imports
- [x] PWA Support
- [x] Layout for Canvas and DOM

- [x] Use esbuild in development for faster HMR
- [x] VSCode debug profiles for the server, Chrome, and Firefox

### :bullettrain_side: Architecture

Inform the nextjs page that the component is a Threejs component. For that, simply add the **r3f** property to the parent component.

```jsx
const Page = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <div>Hello !</div>
      {/* Simply add the r3f prop to the parent component -> */}
      <MeshComponent r3f />
    </>
  )
}

export default Page
```

```jsx
const Page = () => {
  return (
    // even if there is only 1 element add an empty parent to the page component ->
    <>
      {/* If your page doesn't have any 3D and you don't want to render the canvas to improve performances -> */}
      <div noCanvas>Hello !</div>
    </>
  )
}

export default Page
```
